# Personal workflow using streamlit, SqlAlchemy and zeep
- `zeep` is a fantastic tool that simplifies the whole SOAP legacy.  
- `streamlit` with its powerful components really save me a lot of time from learning front end technology.  
- `SqlAlchemy` is still the foundation of the opensource python CRUD web application.  
With these 3 combined and the power of LLMs in 2023, I finally have the ultimate automated workflow.
